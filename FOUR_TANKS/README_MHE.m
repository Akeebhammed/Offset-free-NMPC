## ðŸš€ How to Use

%% Step 1: Run the NMPC Initialization
1. Open MATLAB and set the working directory to:
   ```
   FOUR_TANKS/MHE/state/ OR FOUR_TANKS/EKF/state/ does not matter which on to open first just maintain directory
   ```
2. Open `sample_time.m` and run the script.

3.

%% Step 2: Run the Simulink Model
1. Still in the same directory, open:
   ```
   SIM_4_TANK.slx
   ```
   This will launch Simulink.

2. Change the **Stop Time** (top toolbar) to:
   ```
   1200
   ```

3. Click **Run** to start the simulation.

%% Step 3: Check Results
Once simulation completes:
- Return to the MATLAB window.
  - A **response graph** showing system behavior under disturbances
- You can also view saved images: `estimated_state.jpg`, `state_dist.jpg`, `response.jpg`.
